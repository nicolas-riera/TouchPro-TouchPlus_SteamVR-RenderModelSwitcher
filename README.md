## Usage

*Note : This tool assumes that you're on Windows. It has not been tested on Linux and may not even work.*

Download the tool from the releases and execute it.

You can navigate with numbers and by pressing on Enter.

Note : some SteamVR updates can replace the models to their default state, and the program may not say the correct model type. Just do one of the 2 actions and it should set everything back to normal.
